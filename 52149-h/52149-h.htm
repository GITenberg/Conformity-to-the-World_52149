1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few subjects of greater
practical importance than that considered in these pages, viz.,
Conformity to the World.&nbsp; It is one that penetrates into the
daily life of families, and leads to questions of the most
delicate character between those who are bound together by the
most intimate relationships of life.&nbsp; It is moreover a
subject pre-eminently suited to our times, for I venture to say
there are few amongst <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>us who have not reason to deplore a
sad tendency to worldly conformity amongst those in whom we take
a deep interest.&nbsp; Many of the young people of our day seem
prepared to sweep away all barriers, and to lose sight of all
distinctions; while others, who, we really hope, are Christian
people, who take an interest in Christian objects, and assist us
generally in our parochial work, seem to have forgotten the
landmarks drawn out by our fathers, and, I fear, have become in
consequence weakened in their faith, and paralysed in their
Christian peace.&nbsp; They have become very much like Ephraim as
described in Hos. vii. 8, 9: &lsquo;Ephraim, he hath mixed
himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.&nbsp;
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea,
gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
not.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus in such characters <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>there is a warm
side, and we acknowledge it with thankfulness; but there is a
cold side likewise, and we deeply deplore it.&nbsp; The cake has
not been turned, and the result is a thorough inconsistency of
character.&nbsp; There is sufficient religious interest to blind
the eye to the discovery of decay; but, though they know it not,
the decay is begun, and there are grey hairs stealing upon them,
the outward signs of inward weakness; for they have mixed with
the people, and strangers are devouring their strength.</p>
<p>But we need not suppose that this is a new difficulty, or that
the temptation is now for the first time appearing in the
Church.&nbsp; It was the same in Cowper&rsquo;s day, as we may
gather from his poem:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Renounce the world, the preacher cries.<br
/>
We do&mdash;a multitude replies.<br />
While one as innocent regards<br />
A snug and friendly game at cards;<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>And one,
whatever you may say,<br />
Can see no evil in a play.<br />
Some love a concert, or a race;<br />
And others shooting, or the chase.<br />
Reviled and loved, renounced and followed!<br />
Thus, bit by bit, the world is swallowed.<br />
Each thinks his neighbour makes too free,<br />
Yet likes a slice as well as he.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the difficulty reaches much further back than
Cowper&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; It is in fact as old as the human
heart, for it is part and parcel of it, so that 1800 years ago
the Church of Christ required the same warning that it does now,
and the Apostle Paul gave the inspired caution: &lsquo;Be not
conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of
your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
and perfect will of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word
&lsquo;transformed&rsquo; is alone sufficient to show the
deep-seated character of the evil, for it proves that nothing
less than a transformation <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>is required to enable us to overcome
it.&nbsp; Let human nature go on unchanged, and the result will
be conformity to the world.&nbsp; The world and the love of it
are in the natural heart, and, unless there is a change, there is
sure to be worldly-mindedness in the life.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>THE
WORLD.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we can understand what is
meant by conformity to the world, we must first see clearly what
is meant by the world itself.</p>
<p>There seem to be three senses in which the word is employed in
Scriptures.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is used to express <i>all mankind</i>.&nbsp; I
cannot doubt that this is the meaning of our blessed Saviour in
those memorable words of His: &lsquo;God so loved the world, that
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have
heard a limitation put on that passage, and seen &lsquo;the
world&rsquo; explained as meaning only the elect.&nbsp; But such
an interpretation <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>I believe to be contrary to Scripture.&nbsp; The
expression &lsquo;the world&rsquo; is constantly used for those
who are not amongst the elect, but never, I believe, for those
that are; besides which, the eighteenth verse of the chapter
seems to me to prove conclusively that both classes, viz., those
who believe, and those who do not, are here included in the one
comprehensive term, &lsquo;the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; The words are,
&lsquo;He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that
believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
in the name of the only begotten Son of God:&rsquo; showing, as I
cannot but think, beyond a possibility of contradiction, that
those who perish and those who are saved are included in the
world, which God loved in His deep compassion, and for which He
gave His only begotten Son.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The world stands for <i>this earth and </i><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>all that
belongs to this present life</i>, <i>or dispensation</i>.</p>
<p>Thus of the incarnation St. Paul says that our Lord
&lsquo;came <i>into the world</i> to save sinners.&rsquo; (1 Tim.
i. 15.)&nbsp; So our Lord speaks of His lifetime here as a time
spent in the world: &lsquo;While I was with them in the world, I
kept them in thy name.&rsquo; (John, xvii. 12.)&nbsp; So,
&lsquo;When Jesus knew that the hour was come that he should
depart out of the world, having loved his own which were in the
world, he loved them unto the end.&rsquo; (John, xiii. 1.)&nbsp;
And this I have no doubt is the meaning of His prayer (John,
xvii. 15), &lsquo;I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of
the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the
evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not desire that they should die, or be
removed from the scene of life&rsquo;s labour, but that they
should be preserved in it as a holy and consecrated people.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In the
same sense St. John says, &lsquo;The world passeth away, and the
lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for
ever&rsquo; (1 John, ii. 17); and again, &lsquo;Whoso hath this
world&rsquo;s goods, and seeth his brother have need, and
shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the
love of God in him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But there is a third sense of the term &lsquo;the
world,&rsquo; and one of more frequent occurrence in Scripture
than either of the other two.&nbsp; It is used for <i>the body of
unconverted persons as contrasted with the children of
God</i>.&nbsp; In this contrast there are many points clearly
marked in Scripture.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The two classes are separated by the gift of God,
as we learn from the words of our Lord in John, xvii. 9: &lsquo;I
have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of
the world: thine <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept
thy word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Believers enjoy a fellowship with God to which the
world are strangers.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is it,&rsquo; said Judas
(John, xiv. 22), &lsquo;that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us,
and not unto the world?&nbsp; Jesus answered and said unto him,
If a man love me he will keep my words: and my Father will love
him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; The world has no real knowledge of the Father, of
Christ, or of His people.&nbsp; They may think they know Him, and
may really know a great deal about Him; but as for that knowledge
which our Lord declares to be life eternal, they are perfect
strangers to it, for His language is, &lsquo;Oh righteous Father,
the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these
have known that thou hast <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>sent me.&rsquo; (John, xvii.
25.)&nbsp; In like manner said St. John, when speaking of the
Father&rsquo;s boundless love in 1 John, iii. 1, &lsquo;Behold
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we
should be called the children of God! therefore the world knoweth
us not, because it knew him not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; The world has its origin in this world, and belongs
to it; but believers have their life from God.</p>
<p>So the world are sometimes called &lsquo;the children of this
world,&rsquo; as <i>e.g.</i>, Luke, xvi. 8: &lsquo;The children
of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of
light;&rsquo; and our Lord puts the contrast very plainly when He
says (John, viii. 23), &lsquo;Ye are from beneath, I am from
above: ye are of this world&rsquo; (&#7952;&kappa;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&kappa;&#8057;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;); &lsquo;I am not of
this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, of believers He says, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>that their
life is from above.&nbsp; Just contrast the passage already
quoted with His language in John, xvii. 16.&nbsp; Of the world He
says, &lsquo;Ye are of this world.&rsquo;&nbsp; But of His little
flock, &lsquo;They are not of this world, even as I am not of
this world.&rsquo;&nbsp; They have a life given them from above
(&#7940;&nu;&omega;&theta;&epsilon;&nu;, John, iii. 3), and
therefore St. John plainly declares respecting them (1 John, v.
19), &lsquo;We are of God, and the whole world lieth in
wickedness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; The world has its portion in this world; believers
have their portion in heaven.</p>
<p>The world are like the rich man described by our Lord, to whom
Abraham said, &lsquo;Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; The good things that he sought for were all
connected with this present life, and he received them.&nbsp;
Thus there are few better definitions of men of <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the world
than that given by David in Psalm xvii. 14, when he describes
them as &lsquo;men of the world, which have their portion in this
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every person has his portion somewhere;
<i>i.e.</i>, we all have some treasure at which we are aiming,
something that we are pursuing if we do not all attain it.&nbsp;
Now the portion of the men of the world is altogether in this
present life.&nbsp; I do not mean that they have no vague hope of
going to heaven when they die; but that they are practically
living for the things of time.&nbsp; It is for the things of this
life that they are spending their strength, and here it is that
they really have their portion.</p>
<p>How different it is with those whom God has called out of the
world!&nbsp; They are in the world, but their treasure is in
heaven, and they can say as David did (Psalm xvi. 5), &lsquo;The
Lord is the portion <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>of mine inheritance and my cup: thou maintainest my
lot.&rsquo;&nbsp; To them the world is a crucified thing, as St.
Paul said, &lsquo;By whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; They have a new hope and a new
inheritance; for, being children, they are heirs, heirs of God,
and joint heirs with Christ.&nbsp; Their conversation is in
heaven, because their Saviour is there; and, while they are
diligent in life&rsquo;s occupations, they seek first the kingdom
of God, and His righteousness.&nbsp; They are looking for a city
which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</p>
<p>(6.)&nbsp; But there is another point in which our blessed
Saviour has marked the contrast between the two classes still
more clearly, viz., this, The world does not love Christ or His
people.&nbsp; I know that the first impression produced on many
minds by such a statement would be that there <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>is not this
antipathy in our own times.&nbsp; There is so much kindliness of
heart amongst worldly people, and in many cases they show so much
friendliness, that it is difficult to realise this
hostility.&nbsp; But our Lord distinctly declares it, and all His
words are true.&nbsp; In John, xv. 18, 19, He says, &lsquo;If the
world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
you.&nbsp; If ye were of the world, the world would love his own;
but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
the world, therefore the world hateth you.&rsquo;&nbsp; So again
(John, xvii. 14), &lsquo;I have given them thy word; and the
world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; So St. John echoes His
Master&rsquo;s words, and says (1 John, iii. 13, 14),
&lsquo;Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you: we know
that we have passed from death unto life, <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>because we
love the brethren.&rsquo;&nbsp; In all these passages there is
the contrast clearly marked between the world and those whom God
has called out of it to be a separate people unto Himself; a
contrast so marked that it produces enmity on the part of the
world towards the separated people.&nbsp; But still, as I have
already said, there are multitudes of professing Christians who
are ready to deny the existence of any such enmity, and most of
ourselves have frequently met with generosity and kindness from
those who we cannot but fear are still people of the world.&nbsp;
How then are we to explain this apparent difference between
Scripture and experience?&nbsp; How is it that we do not find a
greater hostility on the part of the world towards the people of
God?&nbsp; Of course the testimony of God&rsquo;s Word must be
true, and the explanation must be sought for in ourselves.&nbsp;
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>I would
suggest to those brethren who think they see a difficulty, three
inquiries which may perhaps remove it.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Do we not sometimes mistake conformity to the
externals of the Gospel for love to Christ?&nbsp; In a Christian
country like this, the most thoroughly worldly persons are
induced, by their sense of respectability, to conform to the
visible practices of Christianity; but it does not follow on that
account, that the real enmity of the human heart towards a
blessed Saviour is removed, or that the offence of the cross has
ceased.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Do we not sometimes mistake personal regard to
ourselves, for a love to the people of God?&nbsp; Men of the
world have strong natural affections, and those natural
affections may happen to be fixed on the children of God; but it
does not follow on <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>that account, that they love either Christ or His
people.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; Are the people of God thoroughly faithful in their
intercourse with the world?&nbsp; Is not an exhibition of the
Lord Jesus Christ so greatly modified in many cases, that the
world is never brought into collision with the high standard held
up by Him?&nbsp; If our Gospel is softened down to meet the
world&rsquo;s mind, of course it will excite no hostility; and I
cannot but fear, that the friendship we so often meet with in the
world, may arise from our taking low ground ourselves, and not
really shining forth as lights in the world, or exhibiting with
sufficient clearness the holy character to which Christ has
called His people.</p>
<p>But without stopping to dwell on these causes for the absence
of the apparent enmity, we must, I think, all admit the clear <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>contrast
drawn in Scripture between the world and the people of God; and
must conclude, that in the various passages referred to
&lsquo;the world&rsquo; includes all those who are not in Him, as
contrasted with those that are.&nbsp; There are two classes, with
a clear line between them&mdash;the world and the people of God;
the world consisting of those who are not in Christ; and the
people of God, of those who are given to Him, called by Him,
justified in Him, born again through His Spirit, and preserved in
Him as vessels for His glory.&nbsp; Thus the world is not limited
to profligate or notorious offenders, but includes all those who
are strangers to the covenant of God in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; The
world might almost be reckoned as a middle class between the
profligate and the people of God; a class having great charms,
and many excellencies; a class having a wisdom of its <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>own,
exceeding, so far as this life is concerned, that of the children
of light; a class including amiable men, moral men, influential
men, and intellectual men; including the refined, as well as the
unrefined&mdash;the gentleman, the statesman, the philosopher,
and, I must add, even the clergyman, provided only that one thing
is wanting, that one thing being a living union with Christ Jesus
the Lord.</p>
<h2><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>CONFORMITY TO THE WORLD.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> this account of the world, we
may proceed to examine what is meant by conformity to it; and in
this examination we must begin with general principles.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">General Principles</span>.</h3>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Conformity to the world is quite distinct from
immorality.</p>
<p>It is a very common thing for persons to say that there is no
harm in such or such an amusement; by which they mean that there
is no profligacy.&nbsp; But conformity to the world is a totally
different thing to profligacy; and though there is no profligacy,
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>there may
be the most thoroughgoing worldliness.&nbsp; The world, in many
cases, condemns open vice as much as the people of God do.&nbsp;
It is most unjust in its sentence; as, for example, when it
brands the poor woman with infamy, and admits her abominable
betrayer into the unrestrained enjoyment of society.&nbsp; But in
many cases it is extremely severe, and it would not be just, or
true, to identify it with debauchery or low-lived habits.&nbsp;
It is altogether far more refined in its character; and though it
may be perfectly true of a young man that he is quite steady, and
free from low vice, it may be equally true that there is no love
of the Lord Jesus in his heart, and that he belongs entirely to
those described by the Psalmist, &lsquo;the men of the world, who
have their portion in this life.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may be quite
impossible to lay your hand upon any one thing that <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>he does, and
pronounce it immoral; but equally impossible to discover in him
anything that savours of the things which be of God, or that
proves him one of those whose conversation is in heaven.</p>
<p>I regard this distinction between immorality and worldliness
as one of the utmost importance in the consideration of the
subject; for I have known many cases in which Christian parents
bring questions to the test of immorality, rather than to that of
worldliness.&nbsp; If there be no immorality in any course of
action they are satisfied, without stopping to consider whether
it is most in harmony with the mind of the world or with the mind
of God.&nbsp; But, if immorality and worldliness are entirely
distinct in their character, it is clear that this latter test is
the only one on which we can rely.&nbsp; If the mind of the world
were the same as the mind of God, then, of <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>course, we
ought to be satisfied if there is nothing in a young
person&rsquo;s conduct which the world condemns; but if it be a
fact that the mind of the world is opposed to the mind of God,
then in His sight we may be altogether wrong, though the world
can discover no harm whatever in our conduct.&nbsp; A young
person may be quite steady, and yet altogether worldly; quite
free from habits of dissipation, but conformed at the same time
to the world; perfectly moral, but of the world, and in it.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Again, conformity to the world does not consist in
diligent attention to the business of life.&nbsp; The rule for
the servant of God is; &lsquo;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
do it with thy might;&rsquo; and we may be perfectly sure, that
God&rsquo;s name will never be honoured by negligence in a
Christian calling.&nbsp; On the other hand, the effect of the
Gospel on the heart will be <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to render the Christian man
pre-eminently effective in that state of life in which it shall
please God to place him.&nbsp; There is nothing in spirituality
of mind to make a person a bad man of business, or to give any
apology for ineffectiveness in common life.&nbsp; If a Christian
man is inaccurate in his accounts, unpunctual in his
appointments, and muddling in his arrangements, it is the effect
not of his religion, but, generally speaking, of his indolence;
for if his religion were properly applied, it would lead him to
act on the scriptural maxim, &lsquo;Not slothful in business,
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; Once more, separation from the world does not
consist in eccentricity.&nbsp; Christian persons are not called
upon to look out for opportunities for making themselves
different to other people.&nbsp; Our Lord came, it is true, to
redeem us to <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Himself &lsquo;a peculiar people.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that
peculiarity is perfectly distinct from singularity, or
eccentricity.&nbsp; It refers simply to the sacred position of
the Lord&rsquo;s people, as redeemed by His blood, and so made
His own, an especial people unto Himself.&nbsp; It is the result
of the great truth taught in the text: &lsquo;The Lord&rsquo;s
portion is his people: Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the blessed fact that we are His, be
consistently followed out in daily life, the distinction will be
quite sure to make itself felt; and it is the duty of the child
of God not to shrink from its being so felt.&nbsp; If we be
amongst the Lord&rsquo;s people we must not be ashamed of it, but
must be prepared for anything that may arise out of the
peculiarity of our high calling.&nbsp; But the Christian is not
called to go out of his way to make the distinction conspicuous,
or to attract attention by anything of his own <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>choosing.&nbsp; If the Lord makes him a marked man, it
is well; but if he makes himself one, though he may really desire
to adorn the Gospel, he may by his own folly make it appear
ridiculous.</p>
<p>What, then, is conformity to the world, and what is the
practical development of it in common life?&nbsp; Its general
principles we have already ascertained.&nbsp; It is living
according to the mind of the world, instead of the mind of God;
and, as far as general principle is concerned, there will
probably be but little difference amongst Christian
persons.&nbsp; The real difficulty lies in the application of
this principle to daily life, and in ascertaining where to draw
the line between that which is desirable and that which is
undesirable, for those whose desire it is to be conformed to the
will of God.&nbsp; In many happy cases there is no difficulty at
all, for it disappears before <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the power of a new affection.&nbsp;
The new affection which God has planted in the heart is so
strong, and so warm, that it settles all questions without
discussion.&nbsp; The new taste finds no relish in the old
habits, and the result is that they drop off of themselves, like
the leaves in autumn.&nbsp; But there is not always this strength
in the new affection; and there are those who are thoroughly
sincere in their desire to follow Christ; and who, we hope, have
really begun to follow Him; who still want help in making up
their mind as to the line they ought to take.&nbsp; They have to
decide on their course of conduct, and sometimes without any
counsel from their friends.&nbsp; They wish to be faithful to
their blessed Saviour, but they are anxious not to give needless
offence.&nbsp; They are afraid of paining those whom they respect
and love, and there is a delicate feeling of <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>modesty,
which makes it extremely painful for them to make a higher
profession than those around them.&nbsp; For such cases, a few
practical suggestions may be an assistance.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Recognition of the
Distinction</span>.</h3>
<p>There is conformity to the world <i>when we ignore the
distinction between the people of God and the world</i>; and
this, I believe, lies at the very root of the subject.&nbsp;
There is nothing more unpopular to the world than this
distinction.&nbsp; The prevailing theory of worldly persons is,
that all are very much alike, provided only that they are
virtuous and amiable; and there is nothing which they dislike
more than the idea of a peculiar people, separated unto God in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; They would wish to be considered right in
their opinion, as their <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>more religious friends are right in
theirs; and if the servants of God will only concede this one
principle, the men of the world will bear almost anything at
their hand.</p>
<p>I am well aware of the practical difficulty of maintaining the
distinction.&nbsp; In many things the world conforms to the
Church, as the Church does to the world; and the line is so
shaded off on both sides, that it is almost beyond man&rsquo;s
power to trace it.&nbsp; The state of things is very much like
two dissolving views at the time when they are passing from one
to the other.&nbsp; There is a faint sketch of both, but no clear
outline to either.&nbsp; Then, again, the last thing that we
desire is to see our young people assuming to themselves a
spiritual superiority, and saying to others, &lsquo;Stand aside,
for I am holier than thou.&rsquo;&nbsp; But still the distinction
is drawn by God in His Word, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and we are guilty of thorough
conformity to the world if we set it aside.&nbsp; Happily, we are
not called to decide where each individual stands; and I know few
things more painful than to hear persons discussing whether
individuals are converted or not.&nbsp; But still the existence
of the distinction in its broad outlines must lie at the basis of
a great deal of our practical conduct, and must not be allowed to
disappear from our guiding principles.&nbsp; If we are in Christ,
adopted as His own holy family, we must not be afraid of
acknowledging Him, or ashamed of being identified with His
people.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dress</span>.</h3>
<p>We are conformed to the world <i>when we adopt the dress and
appearance of the world</i>.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that
Christians are <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>called to make themselves eccentric in their appearance,
or altogether to ignore the changing fashions of the
country.&nbsp; I do not believe that worldliness is avoided by
having a stereotyped dress like nuns or Quakers.&nbsp; The
principle by which, I think, we ought to be guided, is never to
be either in the advance of the fashion, or the extreme of it;
but, when it has become the costume of the country, to adopt it
in moderation.&nbsp; There is no risk of eccentricity if a person
abstains from a new fashion until it has become so common as to
be a part of the national costume, and if it is then adopted in
great moderation there will be nothing at any time to attract
attention.</p>
<p>I know that some take a different line, on the plea, as they
say, that it is necessary to dress according to their station,
and that the style of the dress should be regulated <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>by the income
of the wearer.&nbsp; Thus, I have known some cases of palpable
inconsistency in mistresses, and even Sunday-school teachers, who
have gravely exhorted their servants or scholars against a style
of dress which they themselves were wearing at the time.&nbsp;
But, if the quality varies with the income, which I quite admit,
does it follow that the style should?&nbsp; What is not modest
apparel for the maid, is no better surely for the mistress: and
if it is wrong for the scholar to be showy, it is wrong likewise
for the teacher.&nbsp; Others I have known who have professedly
dressed in the height of the fashion in order to increase their
influence with worldly persons; but surely this is a low and
human policy, and it would be far better for all parties simply
to adhere to Scripture.&nbsp; Human nature has always been the
same, and women loved smart dressing 1800 years ago just as much
as they do <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>now.&nbsp; The costume, of course, was different, so
that the actual directions of those days will not apply to our
own; but the taste was the same, and the Scripture teaches us
plainly that Christian women ought, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, to
keep that taste in subjection and restraint.&nbsp; The language
of St. Paul is, &lsquo;In like manner also that women adorn
themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety;
not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but,
which becometh women professing godliness, with good
works.&rsquo;&nbsp; He considered modest apparel to be the true
adornment of a Christian woman, and surely any deviation from it
is a direct act of conformity to the world.&nbsp; The words of
St. Peter are to the same effect, &lsquo;Whose adorning let it
not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing
of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>it be the
hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even
the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of
God is of great price.&rsquo; (1 Pet. iii. 3, 4.)&nbsp; Surely
such passages show that there is a sin in stylish dressing, and
that the Christian lady will be distinguished from the
fashionable world by the quiet modesty and becoming simplicity of
her appearance.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Society</span>.</h3>
<p>We may be conformed to the world <i>in our intercourse with
society</i>.&nbsp; As long as we are in this life we are thrown
into the midst of other men; and, as members of society, we are
bound by the duties of social life.&nbsp; There are kind
neighbours all around us, many of whom, we may fear, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>are still men
of the world, but who are associated with us through business and
the ties of neighbourhood.&nbsp; How, then, should we act in
society when we really desire not to be conformed to the
world?&nbsp; I do not think that the Christian is to show himself
an exclusive man.&nbsp; &lsquo;He that hath friends must show
himself friendly;&rsquo; and there are many things which he may,
and even ought to do, to all around him.</p>
<p>He should be in all cases a friendly, obliging, and unselfish
neighbour.</p>
<p>He should be open at any time to kind and friendly
intercourse.</p>
<p>He should be ever ready to help his neighbours in all that
concerns either them or their families.</p>
<p>He should be diligently seeking to promote the happiness of
all who are brought into contact with him.</p>
<p>And all this without ever stopping to <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>consider
whether they are the children of God or not.</p>
<p>I believe, also, that he may safely join with them in social
life.&nbsp; Our Lord did it, and therefore they who desire to
follow Him may do it likewise.&nbsp; But let us all remember,
what we are sometimes apt to forget when we look to His example,
that we must be prepared to follow Him <i>throughout</i>, and go,
as He went, wherever we go, as faithful witnesses for God.&nbsp;
Our Lord accepted the invitation of Simon the Pharisee; but He
never forgot His character or mission; and before He left the
dinner-table He both reproved Simon, and saved the poor sinner
that came trembling to His feet.&nbsp; My belief is that this is
the true solution of all the questions that arise respecting
social intercourse with men of the world.&nbsp; I see great
difficulty in artificial rules; but I believe that, when
Christian <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>men seek for God&rsquo;s grace to adorn the Gospel
wherever they are, they will soon find that society sorts
itself.&nbsp; If Simon the Pharisee, or Zaccheus the Publican,
ask them to dinner, let them go, and let them recognise the
hospitality of their friend.&nbsp; But let them be sure they
first seek God&rsquo;s grace that they go as Christian witnesses,
and they will find practically that, unless their Master is
welcomed as well as themselves, they will not be perplexed by
many more invitations.&nbsp; If they go on the principle of
leaving all their Christianity at home, the case is of course
different.&nbsp; They will then be sought for by the world, for
the simple reason that they are conformed to it; for nothing do
worldly men prize more than the implied sanction of those who
bear a high name as religious characters.&nbsp; &lsquo;We cannot
be wrong,&rsquo; say they, &lsquo;for Mr. So-and-So was here; and
we all know <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>what an excellent man he is.&rsquo;&nbsp; Conformity to
the world does not consist in going to the dinner, but in
changing our character as well as our dress, and going there as
men of the world, without letting it be felt that we have sought
the Master&rsquo;s presence, and are anxious for the
Master&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Friends</span>.</h3>
<p>There is conformity to the world in our <i>choice of
friends</i>.</p>
<p>I say &lsquo;our choice of friends,&rsquo; because there are
many given us by God without any choice of our own.&nbsp; There
are often dearly-beloved relations respecting whom we may feel a
deep anxiety; but that anxiety must not deaden the affections, or
take away the natural love which God Himself has planted towards
them.&nbsp; But these are not our chosen friends, not those whom
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>we have
sought out or made for ourselves.&nbsp; But there is probably
scarcely anything that marks a character more than its
friendships.&nbsp; Nothing can be stronger than the Scripture is
upon this subject, &lsquo;Know ye not that the friendship of the
world is enmity against God?&nbsp; Whosoever therefore will be a
friend of the world is the enemy of God.&rsquo; (James, iv.
4.)&nbsp; Thus there is a direct act of conformity to the world
in the cultivation of worldly friendships.&nbsp; If the people of
God are thought dull, and are therefore disregarded, while we
seek our friendships from those who belong to the world, it shows
that there is no affinity with the people of God, and I fear we
must go one step further, and say, no real love for God Himself;
for the words of Scripture are perfectly plain, &lsquo;Every one
that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of
him.&rsquo; (1 John, v. 1.)</p>
<h3><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span><span
class="smcap">Amusements</span>.</h3>
<p>But now I come to that which, I am inclined to think, is the
most difficult portion of our whole subject,
viz.&mdash;<i>amusements</i>.&nbsp; We are conformed to the world
when we go into <i>many of the amusements of the world</i>.&nbsp;
I say &lsquo;into many,&rsquo; because I cannot say all, as many
do not belong exclusively to the world, but are a legitimate
source of recreation to the children of God; and this it is that
makes the subject so pre-eminently difficult.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few general principles which may help to
guide us.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The Christian man has no place in those amusements
<i>which have become practically connected with immorality and
open wickedness</i>.</p>
<p>This principle will clear off a great many <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>at once;
such, for example, as theatres, operas, and races.&nbsp; There is
no harm in racing a horse, acting a play, or the performance of
beautiful music, regarded in the abstract; but in practical life
they are mixed up with gambling, fraud, profligacy, and the
degradation of female character.&nbsp; The mischief has become
part and parcel of the system, so that the Christian man has
nothing to do but to withdraw.&nbsp; He is not called to reform
the racecourse, the ballet, or the stage, so that his only course
is to have nothing whatever to do with them.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But, further still.&nbsp; There is conformity to
the world when we go into those amusements which are <i>decidedly
worldly in their character</i>.&nbsp; As I have already shown,
there may be thorough worldliness where there is no profligacy;
and in such a case it is for the people of God to keep
clear.&nbsp; On this principle, I believe we should abstain <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>from
balls.&nbsp; There is no denying that the fashionable ball is
altogether of the world.&nbsp; The dress, the flirtation, the
excitement, the late hours, are all of the world; and the moral
sense is sufficient to decide that any thing savouring of the
Gospel, or of the Lord Jesus Christ, is utterly out of place in
such a scene.&nbsp; If balls are not worldly, I cannot imagine
what is.&nbsp; I went to some in early life&mdash;sober, quiet,
well-conducted family balls, and I do not hesitate to express my
conviction that I never met with anything in which I have seen so
complete a combination as in the ball-room of the three things
mentioned by St. John, &lsquo;The lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eye, and the pride of life,&rsquo; which are &lsquo;not of
the Father, but of the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some dances, such as
polkas and waltzes, I believe to be objectionable on moral
grounds; and I have known instances in <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>which perfectly steady young men have
been exposed to great temptation through them.&nbsp; I can quite
believe, however, that this is not the case with all, and
therefore it is not the point on which I rest my chief
objection.&nbsp; It is the thorough, avowed, open worldliness of
all balls that I think should lead the Christian to
abstain.&nbsp; The whole thing is of the world.&nbsp; The
conversation is of the world; the gratifications are all of the
world; the excitement is altogether of the world; the society
assembled there is, for the most part, of the world; and,
therefore, I cannot believe that they are the fitting enjoyments
for those who wish to carry out the Apostolic precept, &lsquo;Be
not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and
acceptable and perfect will of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.) Surely the Christian is out of place <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span><i>where he
cannot reasonably hope to enjoy the presence and companionship of
God</i>.</p>
<p>If the whole scene is of such a character that it would be
clearly out of place to speak of the things of His kingdom, and
if the effect of the whole is likely to be such as to forbid
secret communion at the time, or to unfit us for stated prayer
afterwards, it is surely a clear case that such is not the
amusement for those whose earnest desire it is to walk with God,
and to do His will.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; So further, I think we may conclude that, as a
general rule, it is safer and wiser <i>to be guided by the
experience and common practice of the people of God</i>.&nbsp; I
do not mean to say that Christian people are infallible, or that
they may not in some cases draw the line too tight.&nbsp; They
are but men, and they are liable to human failures.&nbsp; But
still they are much more likely to be right in such matters than
those are who have never <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>sought counsel from God upon the
subject.&nbsp; If therefore we see that the most decided
Christians have as a body been led to abstain from a certain
class of amusements, it is surely wise to believe that they have
seen some good reason for doing so, and the prudent course for
the young Christian is to endeavour to avail himself of their
experience, instead of relying on his own wisdom, and so striking
out a new course for himself.&nbsp; This lesson is well taught us
in the Song of Solomon (chap. i. 7, 8).&nbsp; The Bride there
says, &lsquo;Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou
feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why
should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy
companions?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her desire was to be near to the Lord,
and not to turn aside to strangers.&nbsp; Now mark well the
answer: &lsquo;If thou know not, O thou fairest among
women,&rsquo; if thou know not, <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>that is, where to find the beloved,
&lsquo;go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed
thy kids beside the shepherds&rsquo; tents.&rsquo;&nbsp; In order
to find the chief shepherd she was to trace the footsteps of the
flock that followed him, and tracing those footsteps, she would
be guided to her Lord Himself.&nbsp; So if we want to live near
to the Lord, I am persuaded we must not be ashamed of tracing the
footsteps of His people.&nbsp; We must be prepared to identify
ourselves with them; we must not set aside their experience as a
thing of nought; and must so far yield our own will as to be
guided by their concurrent judgment.&nbsp; When, therefore, a
young person finds that all the most decidedly serious persons of
his acquaintance have thought it best to abstain from any
particular amusement, I am persuaded that he is more likely to
enjoy the presence of his Lord if he decides on abstaining <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>with them,
even though he may not see their reasons, than if he sets aside
their experience, and follows in the steps of those whose boast
it is that they make no profession.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; There is another practical suggestion with
reference to amusements, though I cannot urge it as one of
principle; viz., this: <i>There is great risk in adopting</i>,
<i>or introducing</i>, <i>an amusement</i>, <i>if it is likely to
lead on to something further</i>, <i>and you cannot draw any
clear line at which you mean to stop</i>.&nbsp; There are some
things perfectly unobjectionable in themselves, but which become
most objectionable when carried to the extent to which the world
carries them.&nbsp; But yet the shades of difference are so
delicate that it is almost impossible to draw any line that shall
form a stopping point between the innocent beginning and the
objectionable end.&nbsp; Take dancing as <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>an
illustration.&nbsp; In itself, it is a natural, cheerful,
innocent amusement, and a great deal better, in my opinion, than
many others which are substituted for it.&nbsp; But those others
have this advantage, that, when they reach a certain point, they
cease of themselves; whereas, dancing leads straight on to the
ball-room, and you cannot tell your sons or daughters where to
stop.&nbsp; It is offensive to your friends to say that your
young people may dance in your own home, but not in theirs.&nbsp;
Then, again, it is impossible to persuade a young person that the
question of conformity to the world depends on whether the carpet
is taken up or not.&nbsp; You cannot turn the carpet into a test,
as I have known some attempt to do, and say that it is all right
if the carpet is down, but wrong if it is taken up.&nbsp; Nor can
you make the time of leaving off a test, and say that it is <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>right till
eleven, and wrong if it goes on till twelve; or right till
twelve, and wrong if it goes on till one.&nbsp; The result is
that those who begin with what they call family dances find in
most cases that their young people end in being habitual
ball-goers; and very frequently the parents themselves are so
drawn along down the sliding scale that they give up most of
their early principles, and become with their young people, in
such matters, thoroughly conformed to the world.&nbsp; Thus, many
a young person has been like those unfortunate travellers who
perished when crossing the Col de G&eacute;ant.&nbsp; They found
the narrow ridge of rough rock was difficult and fatiguing, so
they turned aside a few paces in order to find an easier path on
the smooth surface of the sloping snow.&nbsp; Of course they had
no idea of doing anything but keep safely along the upper part of
the slope, close to the <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>rocky ridge.&nbsp; But it was not in
their power to choose their own path when once on the
slope.&nbsp; In a fatal moment one slipped, and drew the others
with him.&nbsp; There was no stopping point then, and they were
dashed to atoms over the tremendous precipice below.&nbsp; I am
not surprised, therefore, that most Christian parents have
considered it wiser and safer for their children to keep strictly
to the rocky ridge.</p>
<p>But in saying this I think we must bear in mind that it is
rather a point of Christian prudence than of Christian principle,
and be therefore extremely careful in condemning the conduct of
those who differ from us.&nbsp; It is possible that a truly
Christian person may think that he has discovered a safe stopping
place in the sliding scale; and, if so, we must be careful how we
blame him for conformity to the world, if he goes up to what he
considers <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>the safe limit.&nbsp; We may entirely differ from him,
and believe that he is walking on very dangerous ground.&nbsp;
But he may still be sound in principle, and sincerely anxious not
to be conformed to the world.</p>
<p>(6.)&nbsp; But the next suggestion is one of principle, and of
the utmost importance to the practical consideration of the
subject; viz., this: <i>That no amusement should be entered into
by young persons without the full and hearty concurrence of their
parents</i>.&nbsp; By &lsquo;full and hearty concurrence&rsquo; I
do not mean reluctant permission, almost extorted from them by
the fear of paining their children; but I mean that real approval
which makes the young persons&rsquo; pleasure theirs.&nbsp; I am
persuaded that in such matters the young Christian cannot well
make too much of his parents&rsquo; wishes.&nbsp; I am prepared
to adhere to this even in those cases in which I believe the
young person to be <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>right, and the parent mistaken.&nbsp; Of course if a
clear command from God were involved, the authority of God must
overrule that of a parent; but if the question turn on some point
which the Word of God has left undecided, then surely the young
person is called to yield.&nbsp; To take an example.&nbsp; A
daughter is convinced of the great Scriptural principle,
&lsquo;Be not conformed to this world,&rsquo; and on the strength
of it wishes to give up balls.&nbsp; But her mother wishes her to
accept an invitation to one, and there is a collision between the
judgment of the child and the will of the mother.&nbsp; How,
then, should that young person act?&nbsp; It is an open question
so far as the Scripture is concerned, whether going to balls is
conformity to the world.&nbsp; The young person thinks it is, as
I do.&nbsp; But after all, this is human opinion; whereas it is a
Divine command <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>to honour the father and the mother.&nbsp; But in all
cases the human opinion must give way to the Divine authority,
and therefore the right course appears to be for the young
Christian, under such circumstances, to say to her mother with
the utmost affection and most dutiful respect, that she wishes
from a sense of duty to abstain from such amusements; but that,
if her mother requires it as an act of filial obedience, she is
ready as a child to obey.&nbsp; I have given this advice to many
young persons, and I never knew an instance in which I had
occasion to regret it.&nbsp; But surely the same advice must be
given when it acts in the contrary direction, and, as long as
young people are under their parents&rsquo; roof, even though
they may differ from them, the parents&rsquo; wish must be held
supreme.</p>
<p>We must not, however, forget that the same principle which
calls for obedience <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>in the young calls likewise for fidelity in the
parent.&nbsp; The parents have a responsibility laid upon them so
long as the young people are inmates of their home, a
responsibility which the young person is bound to acknowledge,
and of which the parents cannot divest themselves.&nbsp; Parents
therefore are bound to be faithful, as well as the children to be
submissive.&nbsp; If they consider a particular course of conduct
to be conformity to the world, it is their duty as Christian
parents plainly to say so.&nbsp; They should let their minds be
known, and let it be an understood thing that the course adopted
is opposed to their judgments and their wish.&nbsp; There are
very few Christian families in which the knowledge of the
parents&rsquo; wish is not sufficient; and when young persons are
ready to submit to the judgment of their parents, it is clearly
due to them that the parent should not shrink <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>from the
responsibility of decision.&nbsp; It is an easy thing to get rid
of a difficulty by saying that at their age young persons must do
as they like; but it is not fair to do so when the young persons
are dutifully disposed, and perfectly ready to yield to their
parents&rsquo; judgment.&nbsp; In such a case the son or daughter
has a right to look to the parent for a decided expression of his
opinion and wish.&nbsp; When things are as they ought to be in a
Christian home, the parents&rsquo; wish is followed at
once.&nbsp; If that wish is clearly expressed, and then
disregarded, the blame lies on the young people; but if, from any
motive, the parents withhold the expression of their wish, then
they must be held responsible, and they have no right to express
regret at the worldly conformity of their children.</p>
<p>But, besides the duty towards the children, it is important
not to forget the responsible <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>position which the parent occupies in
society; for, as a general rule, parents are held to a great
extent responsible for the amusements adopted by the young people
under their roof.&nbsp; If we could get behind the scenes we
should often hear it argued that Mr. A. allows his daughters to
adopt a certain line of conduct, or that Mr. B. makes no
objection; whereas it is not impossible that they have both
objected strongly, but have not had the moral courage to take the
responsibility of withholding their consent.&nbsp; The result is,
that they are thought by their friends to sanction that which
they disapprove, and they practically throw the weight of their
influence into the support of that which they think
undesirable.</p>
<p>But let it not be supposed, that in saying this, I do not
enter into the anxieties of parents, for I have seen too much of
life <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>not
to know how great they are, and how strong are the considerations
which sometimes make many waver when deciding for their children,
who would never hesitate as to their own conduct.</p>
<p>Some are afraid of exciting a prejudice against their
principles; and their earnest desire to see their dear children
living in Christ makes them glad to soften down as much as
possible the distinction between His people and the world.&nbsp;
I can enter most heartily into such a feeling, and I am persuaded
that no wise Christian would ever wish to put a needless cross in
the way of his family.&nbsp; Still we must make up our minds to
the conviction, that neither they nor we can follow Christ
without the cross.&nbsp; There is a cross to be borne, and we
shall utterly mislead those who are guided by us if we suppose
that it is melted away by modern improvements in society.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>We have
therefore plainly to face the fact that our Christian principles
involve a cross, and we shall never really commend them to others
by presenting them in such a modified form as to keep out of
sight their true character.&nbsp; If we succeed in persuading
young persons to accept such a modification, there is danger of
our becoming the unintentional means of deceiving them as to
their true position before God.</p>
<p>Others, who feel strongly themselves, are afraid of drawing
the line too tight for others, and so causing a reaction when the
tension ceases.&nbsp; I can thoroughly enter into these fears,
and most fully acknowledge the danger.&nbsp; But I do not believe
it is avoided by the parent&rsquo;s departure from his own
principles; but rather by the prayerful and painstaking
endeavour, in accordance with those principles, to make his home
thoroughly cheerful.&nbsp; It is the <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>greatest possible mistake, to suppose
that exciting amusements and large parties are essential to the
happiness of the young.&nbsp; On the contrary, I believe that,
when the collapse after the excitement is taken into account,
they will be found on the whole to diminish it.&nbsp; The real
happiness of a young man&rsquo;s vacation depends on the
resources of his home; and the best safeguard against the
irritating effect of real consistency is to make the home so
thoroughly cheerful that there is no desire for extraneous
excitement.&nbsp; This is not always easy, and in all cases
requires prayerful self-denial and painstaking.&nbsp; If a family
is left to itself, to amuse itself as best it may, who can wonder
that the evenings often hang very heavily?&nbsp; But when the
dearly beloved mother throws her whole heart into the interests
of all around her; when she is always planning for that which may
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>make the
day pass pleasantly; always on the look-out for good books and
good friends; always ready to deny herself so as to cheer away a
dull half-hour, and to throw herself with real interest into all
the amusements of her family; and when the father takes his share
in all that is going on, his share of interest, if he cannot
afford his share of time, and so gives all the support in his
power to her on whom the home life must mainly depend for its
attractions, it will seldom be found that the young persons crave
after excitement, for the simple reason that they are satisfied
at home.&nbsp; I need scarcely remark what a rich reward such
parents reap for their painstaking, and how deeply thankful they
should be, if the Lord so bless their efforts as to make what
some call the tightness of the line never felt by those who are
gently guided by it.</p>
<h2><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> while these practical
suggestions may be helpful to some who are doubtful as to their
practical conduct, it is important for us to remember well that
the root of conformity to the world is not found in those
practices which lie on the surface, but in the deep affections of
the natural heart; so that whatever rules we adopt we are
conformed to the world when we are living for the things of the
world.&nbsp; We found at the outset that the men of the world are
described as those who have their portion in this life.&nbsp; So
we are conformed to the world when the portion in this life is
the great end and object of our <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>pursuit.&nbsp; Turning to the epistle
of St. Paul to Titus we find that the grace of God which bringeth
salvation is to have a twofold effect on the character.&nbsp; It
is to wean, and to attract.&nbsp; The weaning process is
described, when he says, &lsquo;Teaching us that denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world;&rsquo; and the
attractive power in the words, &lsquo;Looking for that blessed
hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour
Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now we must not suppose that by the
word &lsquo;lust&rsquo; is meant only sensuality.&nbsp; It is the
old English word for desire.&nbsp; Thus, worldly desires, or
desires after the world, are placed side by side with
ungodliness, and both are to be denied by those who know the
grace of God which bringeth salvation.&nbsp; Here lies the root
of the matter.&nbsp; If the affections are still fixed on the
world, and <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>the desires bent on it, it is in vain to tell a man that
in practice he shall not be conformed to it.&nbsp; Where his
treasure is there will his heart be also, and where the heart
leads the way, the steps are almost sure to follow.&nbsp; If,
therefore, the affections be fixed on the friendships of the
world, and the desires are bent on the good things of the
world&mdash;its wealth, its honours, its popularity, its
applause, its high positions, we must expect that questions which
arise in practice will be referred, not to the balance of the
sanctuary, but to the balance of the world; and it is hopeless to
look for any decided line of action.&nbsp; But this must not be
the case with the children of God.&nbsp; If we be in Christ we
know the grace of God which bringeth salvation; we have been
redeemed unto God by the precious blood of Jesus; we are sealed
unto Him by the Holy Spirit of Promise, we are kept as His
purchased <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>possession until the day of His return: we are looking,
waiting, hoping for that happy time when He shall take the
kingdom, and all these earthly things pass away for ever; and are
we to be looking backwards instead of forwards?&nbsp; Are we to
be fostering the earthly affection, and losing sight of the
heavenly?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Let the world seek its own, and enjoy
it while it lasts.&nbsp; But it won&rsquo;t last long.&nbsp;
Still, while it does last men of the world are consistent in
living for it.&nbsp; No one can accuse them of
inconsistency.&nbsp; What we ask for is a similar consistency in
those whose conversation is in heaven, and whose desire it is to
walk with God.&nbsp; If we know Him let us keep our eye steadily
fixed on Him; let us not be afraid of going forth without the
camp, if only we can trace His footsteps in the path; and let us
never lose sight of the Divine precept, &lsquo;If ye then be
risen with <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ
sitteth on the right hand of God.&nbsp; Set your affections on
things above, not on things of the earth.&nbsp; For ye are dead,
and your life is hid with Christ in God.&rsquo;</p>

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
